# Anime School Presentation

This presentation was made for my english class project about anime.

### The presentation
`presentation.odp` and `script.odt` are the main presentation files.
`presentation.odp` is the presentation containing basic section titles and background images to represent the titles.
`script.odt` is the script where the one who presents follows script rules where talks about the presentation section and interracts.

The presentation and script files(including `censored.odt` as well) were written in the Open Document format, which can be opened with Open Document document editors like LibreOffice or OpenOffice. You can legally convert these to MS Office formats or other closed source Document Formats, **but for god's love DON'T do it please!**

`aniplay.sh` is a BASH script which purpose is to play in `mpv` as fullscreen mode https://youtu.be/mco3UX9SqDA - `【初音ミク】ぽっぴっぽー - Po pi po ~ Miku Hatsune Vegetable Juice Dance`.
